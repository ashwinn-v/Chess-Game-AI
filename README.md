# A Game of Chess using  Monte Carlo Tree Search
Used the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to simulate a game of chess that progresses by calculating the best move every single time. This model could serve as a system of reference to learn potentially best moves in different scenarios which arise in a game of chess. The webapp of the chess game is deployed using Streamlit.
